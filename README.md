# CS-532 Project Topic modeling LSA Annotated Bibliography

As technology advances, tons of information are generated everyday. It would cost a lot of time and money to read through every single document to find the information we needed. Therefore, if we can efficiently associate each document with relevant topics it contains, we can improve the process of information retrieval. This goal can be achieved through topic modeling, which discovers abstract topics embedded in a collection of documents. <br><br>
In this project, we will explore a renowned method of topic modeling, latent semantic analysis (LSA), that uses a  singular value decomposition (SVD) approach [(Gong & Liu, 2001)](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~pxt/IDA/text_summary.pdf). Although LSA can enhance information retrieval, there are also limitations such as data sparsity or large storage space problems. Therefore, we are also keen to find out how LSA can be improved by incorporating syntactic information  [(Kanejiya, Kumar & Prasad, 2003)](https://doi.org/10.3115/1118894.1118902), part of speech [(Kakkonen, Myller & Sutinen, 2006)](https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0610118), or implementing regularization methods of lasso and ridge regression [(Wang, Q., Xu, J., Li, H., & Craswell, N., 2013)](http://www.hangli-hl.com/uploads/3/1/6/8/3168008/rlsi-tois-revision.pdf).
